---DuplicateServiceException JBoss Server
eclipse wildfly plugin doesn't remove existing artifacts(war/jar/ear) correctly
solution: remove artifacts within <root-path>wildfly-10.1.0.Final\standalone\deployments
then start wildfly log into admin webconsole and remove artifacts from deployment
After all of the above run artifact on server in eclipse shouldn't run into exception
